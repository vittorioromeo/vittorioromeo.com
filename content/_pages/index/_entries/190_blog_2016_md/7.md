Andy Meyer, a Linux user and Open Hexagon fan, has packaged the 2.0-RC2 version for Debian systems.

Thanks Andy!

[You can find the package here](http://vittorioromeo.com/Misc/Temp/OpenHexagon2.0-RC2.deb) or on the projects page.

Servers are still down at the moment. I'm very busy with university and other projects - I hope to find some free time soon to work on them.
